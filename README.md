### Getting Started
---
It is highly recommended that you use a php development environment that works out of the box with Laravel. If you are on Mac your best option is probably [Laravel Valet](https://github.com/laravel/valet). If you are using a Windows Environment I would recommend either setting a PHP Development Environment using the WSL or Docker. I am personally using Docker with [DevilBox](https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox) which is good for most web development.
